# Hackpad but KERBAL!!!!!!!
I have recently developed a crippling addiction to Kerbal Space Program. It's all I think about. When I'm awake I think about KSP, when I'm working on physics homework I think about the delta-v needed to land on Duna, when I'm asleep I dream of Kraken attacks. Naturally, the next step is to design an entire hackpad focused solely on feeding that addiction.
This hackpad uses a rotary encoder to shift between 2 layers: WASD rotational inputs and IJKL translational inputs. It's designed to make docking easier, as well as having an extra key that can be bound to a custom action (though for now it will remain as the staging button).

# The Case
The case is made from 2 3D printed pieces. The center rectangle is a size-accurate representation of the PCB
